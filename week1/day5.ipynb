With its streaming memory architecture, SAM2 can track and refine object masks across long videos in real time, making it one of the most powerful models for interactive and automatic video segmentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model builds a memory bank of past frames and prompts, encoding both spatial features and compact “object pointer” tokens that summarize the target. Each new frame is then processed in relation to this memory through attention, letting SAM2 recall what the object looked like and where it was last observed. Combined with an explicit occlusion prediction head, this design allows SAM2 to keep track of objects robustly and to recover them with minimal user input after partial or full occlusion.\n",
